### JHSPH IRB Research Plan for New Data Collection


**PI Name:**

**Study Title:**

**IRB Number:**

**PI Version No. / Date:**

<br> 

#### I. Aims of the Study:

Describe the aims/objectives of the research and/or the project’s research questions or hypotheses.

#### II.	Background and Rationale:

Explain why this study is being done.  Summarize briefly what is already known about the issue and reference previously published research, if relevant.

#### III. Study Design

**A. Provide a BRIEF overview of your study design and methods.**

The study design must relate to your stated aims/objectives.  DETAILS WILL BE REQUESTED LATER.  If your study also involves analysis of existing data, please complete Section XI, “Secondary Data Analysis of Existing Data” in the last part of this research plan.  If your study ONLY involves analysis of existing data, please use the research plan template for secondary data analysis (JHSPH IRB Research Plan for Secondary Data Analysis of Existing Data/Specimens)  

**B. Provide a sample size and a justification as to how you arrived at that number.**

If you use screening procedures to arrive at a final sample a table may be helpful.   


#### IV. Participants

Describe the study participants and the population from which they will be drawn.  Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  If you plan to include children, note their ages and whether you will include children in foster care. Note if the participants are particularly vulnerable in terms of cognitive limitations, education, legal migration status, incarceration, poverty, or some combination of factors. 

**A. Inclusion Criteria:** 

	

**B. Exclusion Criteria:**

NOTE: If you are recruiting participants or receiving, accessing, or using data from a U.S. health care provider, HIPAA review is likely to be required.  If you plan to bring identifiable health information from a foreign country to a U.S. covered entity (e.g., lab at the Hopkins SOM), HIPAA may be triggered. Check “yes” to the HIPAA question in the PHIRST application.


#### V. Study Procedures:

In this section, provide details of your procedures, particularly as they relate to human subjects. If this is a multi-center study, make the role of JHSPH clear.  If the JHSPH will serve as data coordinating center, indicate in the sections below which procedures JHSPH will not be performing.  Additional information regarding data coordinating centers is requested in a later section.  If your study will develop in phases, address each item below by phase.


**A.Recruitment Process:** 

1.	Describe how you will identify, approach, and inform potential participants about your study.  Include details about who will perform these activities and what their qualifications are.


2.	Address any privacy issues associated with recruitment.  If recruitment itself may put potential participants at risk (if study topic is sensitive, or study population may be stigmatized), explain how you will minimize these risks.

**B.Consent Process:**

1. Describe the following details about obtaining informed consent from study participants.  If a screening process precedes study enrollment, also describe the consent for screening.
  a. Who will obtain informed consent, and their qualifications:
	b. How, where, and when the consent discussion(s) will occur:
	c. The process you will use to determine whether a potential participant meets eligibility criteria:
	d. Whether you will obtain a signature from the participant or will use an oral consent process:
	e. Whether you will obtain a legally authorized representative’s signature for adults lacking capacity:
	f. If children are included in the study, if and how you will obtain assent from them:
	g. If children are included in the study, how you will obtain permission for them to participate from their parent, legal guardian, or other legal authority (if child is in foster care or under government supervision):
	h. If you are seeking a waiver of informed consent or assent, the justification for this request:
	i. Whether you will include a witness to the consent process and why:
	j. If the language is unwritten, explain how you will communicate accurate information to potential participants and whether you will use props or audio materials:

2.	Identify the countries where the research will take place, and the languages that will be used for the consent process.  

```{r,echo=FALSE}
dt = tibble(Country = "", 
            `Consent Documents` = "Adult Consent, Parental Permission, etc.",
            Languages = "")

dt %>%
  flextable() %>%  
  autofit() %>%
  align(align = "center", part = "all")
```


3. Study Implementation 

  a. Describe the procedures that participants will undergo.  If complex, insert a table below to help the reviewer navigate.  
  b. Describe the number and type of study visits and/or contacts between the study team and the participant, how long they will last, and where/how they will take place.
  c. Describe the expected duration of the study from the perspective of the individual participant and duration overall.
  d. Provide a brief data analysis plan and a description of variables to be derived. 

4.  Provide a brief data analysis plan and a description of variables to be derived. 

5. Answer the following if they are relevant to your study design:

  a. If the study has different arms, explain the process for assigning participants (intervention/control, case/control), including the sequence and timing of the assignment.
  b. If human biospecimens (blood, urine, saliva, etc.) will be collected, provide details about who will collect the specimen, the volume (ml) and frequency of collection, how the specimen will be used, stored, identified, and disposed of when the study is over.  If specimens will be collected for use in future research (beyond this study), complete the “Biospecimen Repository” section below.
  c. If genetic/genomic analyses are planned, address whether the data will be contributed to a GWAS or other large dataset.  Address returning unanticipated incidental genetic findings to study participants.
  d. If clinical or laboratory work will be performed at JHU/JHH, provide the JH Biosafety Registration Number.
  e. If you will perform investigational or standard diagnostic laboratory tests using human samples or data, clarify whether the tests are validated and/or the lab is certified (for example is CLIA certified in the U.S.).  Explain the failure rate and under what circumstances you will repeat a test.  For all human testing (biomedical, psychological, educational, etc.), clarify your plans for reporting test results to participants and/or to their families or clinicians.  Address returning unanticipated incidental findings to study participants.
  f. If your study involves medical, pharmaceutical or other therapeutic intervention, provide the following information:
  * Will the study staff be blind to participant intervention status?  
  * Will participants receive standard care or have current therapy stopped?
  * Will you use a placebo or non-treatment group, and is that justifiable?
  * Explain when you may remove a participant from the study.
  * What happens to participants on study intervention when the study ends?   
  * Describe the process for referring participants to care outside the study, if needed.
    
#### VI. Data Custody, Management, Security, and Confidentiality Protections:

    - Provide an estimated sample size and an explanation for that number.
    - Provide a brief data analysis plan and a description of variables to be derived.
* **Participants**
    - Describe the subjects who provided the original data and the population from which they were drawn.  Note: If you are receiving, accessing, or using data from a U.S. health care provider, the need for HIPAA review is likely.  If you plan to bring identifiable health information from a foreign country to a U.S. covered entity (e.g., lab at the Hopkins SOM), HIPAA may be triggered.  If either of these conditions is met, check “yes” to the HIPAA question in the PHIRST application.  
	  - If you plan to analyze human specimens or genetic/genomic data, provide details about the source of those specimens and whether they were collected using an informed consent document.  If yes, explain whether your proposed use is “consistent with” the scope of the original consent, if it potentially introduces new analyses beyond the scope of the original consent, and/or if it introduces new sensitive topics (HIV/STDs, mental health, addiction) or cultural/community issues that may be controversial.
  - Explain whether (and how) you plan to return results to the participants either individually or as a group.

#### XII. Oversight Plan for Student-Initiated Studies:  							

* For student-initiated studies, explain how the PI will monitor the student’s adherence to the IRB-approved research plan, such as communication frequency and form, training, reporting requirements, and anticipated time frame for the research.  Describe who will have direct oversight of the student for international studies if the PI will not personally be located at the study site, and their qualifications.
* What is the data custody plan for student-initiated research?  (Note:  Students may not take identifiable information with them when they leave the institution.)  



#### XIII.	Creation of a Biospecimen Repository: 						

Explain the source of the biospecimens, if not described above, what kinds of specimens will be retained over time.  Clarify whether the specimens will be obtained specifically for repository purposes, or will be obtained as part of the core study and then retained in a repository.

* Describe where the biospecimens will be stored and who will be responsible for them.
* Describe how long the biospecimens will be stored, and what will happen at the end of that period.
* Explain whether the biospecimens will be shared with other investigators, inside and outside of JHU, how the decision to share will be made, and by whom.  Include your plans, if any, for commercial use.  Also explain how downstream use of the specimen will be managed, and what will happen to left-over specimens.  
* Describe whether future research using the biospecimens will include specimen derivation and processing (cell lines, DNA/RNA, etc.), genomic analyses, or any other work which could increase risk to participants. Explain what additional protections will be provided to participants.
* If future research could yield unanticipated incidental findings (e.g., an unexpected finding with potential health importance that is not one of the aims of the study) for a participant, do you intend to disclose those findings to the study participant?  Please explain your position.
* Explain whether the specimens will be identifiable, and if so, how they will be coded, who will have access to the code, and whether the biospecimens will be shared in linked (identifiable) form.
* Explain whether the repository will have Certificate of Confidentiality protections. 
* Explain whether a participant will be able to withdraw consent to use a biospecimen, and how the repository will handle a consent withdrawal request.
* Describe data and/or specimen use agreements that will be required of users.  Provide a copy of any usage agreement that you plan to execute with investigators who obtain biospecimens from you.

#### XIV. Data Coordinating Center:  								

Complete if JHSPH serves as the Data Coordinating Center.
   
* How will the study procedures be developed?  
* How will the study documents that require IRB approval at each local site be developed?  Will there be some sort of steering or equivalent committee that will provide central review and approval of study documents, or will template consent forms, recruitment materials, data collection forms, etc. be developed by and provided to the local sites by the coordinating center without external review? 
* Will each local clinical site be overseen by its own IRB with an FWA, or will a Single IRB review the study?  State whether the coordinating center will collect IRB approvals and renewals from the clinical centers; if not, explain why.
* How will the coordinating center provide each local site with the most recent version of the protocol and other study documents?  What will be the process for requesting that these updates be approved by local clinical center IRBs?
* What is the plan for collecting data, managing the data, and protecting the data at the coordinating center? 
* What is the process for reporting and evaluating protocol events and deviations from the local sites? Who has overall responsibility for overseeing subject safety: the investigators at the recruitment site, the Coordinating Center, the Steering Committee, or a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)? Is there a DSMB that will evaluate these reports and provide summaries of safety information to all the reviewing IRBs, including the coordinating center IRB?  Please note that if there is a DSMB for the overall study, then the coordinating center PI does not have to report to the coordinating center IRB each individual adverse event/problem event that is submitted by the local site PIs.
* Some FDA regulated studies have different AE reporting criteria than that required by the IRB (IRB Policy No. 103.06).  How will you reconcile the different requirements, and who is responsible for this reconciliation? 
* Who is responsible for compliance with the study protocol and procedures and how will the compliance of the local sites be monitored and reviewed?  How will issues with compliance be remedied?

#### XV. Drug Products, Vitamins, Food and Dietary Supplements:

Complete this section if your study involves a drug, botanical, food, dietary supplement or other product that will be applied, inhaled, ingested or otherwise absorbed by the study participants.  If you will be administering drugs, please upload the product information.

* List the name(s) of the study product(s), and the manufacturer/source of each product.
```{r,echo=FALSE}

dt = tibble::tribble(
  ~ `Name of Product`,         ~`Manufacturer or Source`,
   " ",                                " "
)

dt %>%
  flextable() %>%   autofit() %>%   align(align = "center", part = "all")

```
* List each study product by name and indicate its approved/not approved status.
```{r,echo=FALSE}

dt = tibble::tribble(
  ~ `Approved by the FDA and Commercially Available`, ~`Approved by Another Govt Entity (provide name)`, ~`Cleared for Use at Local Study Site`,
   " ",                                " ",                                 "",
)

dt %>%
  flextable() %>%   autofit() %>%   align(align = "center", part = "all")

```
* If your study product has an Investigational New Drug (IND) application through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, provide the IND number, and the Investigators Brochure. 
* If your study product is a marketed drug, provide the package inserts or other product information.  If the study product WILL NOT be used for its approved indication, dose, population, and route of administration, provide a detailed rationale justifying the off-label use of the study product. 
* If the study product does not require FDA approval (e.g., dietary supplements, botanicals, products not subject to the U.S. FDA, etc.), provide safety information (as applicable) and a certificate of analysis.
* Explain who will be responsible for drug management and supply, labeling, dispensing, documentation and recordkeeping.  Complete and upload into PHIRST the Drug Data Sheet available on the JHSPH IRB website at www.jhsph.edu/irb.
* What drug monitoring and/or regulatory oversight will be provided as part of the study?


#### XVI. Medical Devices:

Complete this section if your study will involve an approved or investigational medical device (diagnostic, non-significant risk, significant risk).  

* List the name(s) of the study product(s), the manufacturer/source of each product, and whether or not it is powered (electric, battery).  Provide product information.  If it is electric, upload documentation of clinical engineering approval or its equivalent from a local authority, to ensure that the device is in good working order.
```{r,echo=FALSE}

dt = tibble::tribble(
  ~ `Name of study Product`,     ~`Manufacturer or Source`,           ~`Powered?`,
   " ",                                " ",                                 "",
)

dt %>%
  flextable() %>%   autofit() %>%   align(align = "center", part = "all")

```
* List each study product by name and indicate its status as approved by a government authority or not approved.
```{r,echo=FALSE}

dt = tibble::tribble(
  ~ `Approved by the FDA and Commercially Available`, ~`Approved by Another Govt Entity (provide name)`, ~`Cleared for Use at Local Study Site`,
   " ",                                " ",                                 "",
)

dt %>%
  flextable() %>%   autofit() %>%   align(align = "center", part = "all")

```
* If your investigational device is Exempt from the FDA IDE regulations, explain which section of the code applies to your device and why it meets the criteria provided.  If it is a diagnostic device, provide pre-clinical information about the sensitivity and specificity of the test and the anticipated failure rate.  If you plan to provide the results to participants or their physicians, justify doing so, and explain how those results will validated (or not) against the current “gold standard”.  
* If you believe the investigational device is not IDE exempt under 21CFR 812.2(c), but is a “Non-Significant Risk” device considered to have an approved IDE application, provide information from the manufacturer supporting that position.
* If you are using an investigational device that is a Significant Risk Device, provide the IDE number given by the FDA, or if not under FDA jurisdiction, explain why it is appropriate to use this device in this study.  Provide a description of the device, and upload a picture or manufacturing schematics into PHIRST.  Provide any other information relevant to a determination of its safety to be used for the purposes outlined in this research plan.
